# Synthetic Chemist

## Education

  - Ph.D., Chemistry || University of California, Berkeley (May 2024)
  - B.Sc., Chemistry || University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (May 2018)

## Purpose
This site is a hub documenting my experience, publications, and projects. My goal is to add content that engages with the current synthetic inorganometallic chemistry literature and other chemical interests such as spirits, food, and writing. 

## Experience
**Post-doctoral Research Chemist at U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research (October 2024 - April 2025)**
- Synthesized and purified organic small molecules between 0.1 - 25 g scales for testing in rubber.
- Used rheometry and SEC-MALS to track interaction of new rubber additives.

**Graduate Student Researcher at University of California, Berkeley (August 2018 - May 2024)**
- Synthesized metal oxo cubanes using Schlenk and Glovebox techniques through completely new route.
- Elucidated new mechanism through UV-Vis, isotopic labeling, and electrochemistry.
- Assisted in managing a HR-ESI-MS, UV-Vis, and FTIR in a shared user facility.
- Personally collected over 2000 NMR spectra, 650 HR-ESI-MS spectra, in addition to GC-MS, ATR-IR, CV, EA, EPR, ssNMR, and SC-XRD analyses to validate purity/strcture/screen new compounds.

**Undergraduate Researcher at University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (Jan 2015 - May 2018)**
- Developed 10+ substituted transition metal catalysts and monitored kinetics and product regioselectivity by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Optimized selectivity by iterative non-linear approach.
- Synthesized group reagents, organic substrates, and repaired vacuum pumps.
